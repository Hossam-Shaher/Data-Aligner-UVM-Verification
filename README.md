# Data Aligner: UVM Verification
The **Data Aligner** takes in an unaligned stream of data and outputs it as an aligned stream of data based on its configuration.

In this project, the Data Aligner is modeled and verified using the **SystemVerilog HDVL** and the **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)**. 

This project is the course project of this Udemy course: [`Design Verification with SystemVerilog/UVM`](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-verification-with-systemverilog-uvm/).
